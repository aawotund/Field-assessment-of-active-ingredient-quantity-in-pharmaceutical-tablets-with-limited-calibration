# Field assessment of active ingredient quantity in pharmaceutical tablets with limited calibration of near infrared spectra - An application to ciprofloxacin tablets
Developed Statistical Models that explore NIR spectra features of active ingredients in pharmaceuticals from multiple NIR spectrometers to probe pharmaceutical quality
A portable Near Infra Red (NIR) spectometer was explored in this study to probe lab-formulated Ciprofloxacin samples housed in clear capsule (NOW,Bloomingdale, IL). NIR spectrometer spectra features for an identical pill like Ciprofloxacin tablet could be similar but may slightly vary when another NIR spectrometer is used. Variation in spectrometer could significantly impact predictive models. We tested the robustness of the spectra generated by our NIR spectrometer from lab-made Ciprofloxacin formulations on field samples spectra of Ciprofloxacin tablets of another spectrometer. High performance liquid chromatography was performed on the field samples to cross validate the predictions from our model.

Mixture of Ciprofloxacin and alpha crystalline cellulose were formulated in the lab with active pharmaceuticals ingredients (API)- Ciprofloxacin content (w/w) used in the regression studies. We used this as hypothetical study as most Ciprofloxacin exist in tablet forms rather than in capsules.Our study revealed that models developed from lab-made Ciprofloxacin formulation housed in a clear capsule can be used to probe Ciprofloxacin tablets from the field samples with a good accuracy.
